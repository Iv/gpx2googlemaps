gpx2googlemaps - GPX to Google Maps converter
Copyright (C) Tom Payne  2009


INTRODUCTION

gpx2googlemaps is designed for making turnpoint maps for paragliding and hang
gliding competitions.  It reads a GPX file as input and generates a turnpoint
map using map tiles from Google Maps.


REQUIREMENTS

gpx2googlemaps requires:
* pycairo http://www.cairographics.org/pycairo/
* ImageMagick http://www.imagemagick.org/

On Ubuntu systems the packages are called python-cairo and imagemagick
respectively.
	$ sudo apt-get install python-cairo imagemagick


QUICK START

Given one or more GPX files containing waypoints, gpx2googlemaps will produce
a waypoint map called map.png.  For example:
	./gpx2googlemaps frutigen.gpx
This can take a long time the first time that you run the command since
gpx2googlemaps must download all the map tiles from Google.  These map tiles
are cached in a temporary directory (/tmp/gpx2googlemaps by default).


DEALING WITH NON-GPX FORMATS

The input file must be in GPX format.  If you have a .WPT file it is typically
in either OziExplorer or CompeGPS format and you can use GPSBabel
(http://www.gpsbabel.org) to convert it, for example:
	$ gpsbabel -i compegps -f filename.wpt -o gpx -F filename.gpx
or
	$ gpsbabel -i ozi -f filename.wpt -o gpx -F filename.gpx


SPECIFYING THE ZOOM LEVEL

You can increase the zoom level with the --zoom option, for example:
	$ ./gpx2googlemaps --zoom=12 frutigen.gpx
Higher zoom levels generate larger maps with more detail which may or may not
be desirable.  Depending on the size of your flying area, zoom levels 11 to
13 usually give the best compromise between detail and size.


TRUNCATING WAYPOINT NAMES

Waypoint names can be very long and in paragliding competitions we tend to
only use the first three characters.  You can tell gpx2googlemaps to truncate
the waypoint names using the --truncate option, for example:
	$ ./gpx2googlemaps --truncate=3 frutigen.gpx


LIMITING THE AREA COVERED BY THE MAP

By default, gpx2googlemaps will make the map large enough to include all the
waypoints in the input file.  If you have a number of distant waypoints (e.g.
remote goals) then you may wish to limit the map to a certain area.  You can
do this with the --bounds option, for example:
	$ ./gpx2googlemaps --bounds=F05,F07,F21,F22 frutigen.gpx
This will ensure that all the map covers all the waypoints specified.

You can also specify coordinates explicitly as latitude:longitude pairs, for
example:
	$ ./gpx2googlemaps --bounds=46.5:7.5,46.7:7.7 frutigen.gpx


GENERATING A MAP WITHOUT WAYPOINTS

You can generate a map without any waypoints using the --bounds option on its
own, for example:
	$ ./gpx2googlemaps --bounds=46.5:7.5,46.7:7.7


CHANGING THE OUTPUT FILE NAME

The default output filename is map.png, this can be overridden with the
--output option, for example:
	$ ./gpx2googlemaps --output=frutigen.png frutigen.gpx


KNOWN BUGS

If two waypoints are close together then their labels can overlap.
